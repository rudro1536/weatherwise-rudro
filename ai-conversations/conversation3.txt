Me: How do I build a basic menu system with pyinputplus that guides users through different weather options?

AI: To build a basic menu system with `pyinputplus` that guides users through different weather options, you can use the `pyinputplus.inputMenu()` function. This allows you to present a list of choices to the user and take input in a clean, user-friendly way.

### Here's a simple example:

```python
import pyinputplus as pyip

def show_weather_info(option):
    if option == 'Current Weather':
        print("Showing current weather...")
        # Add your logic to fetch and display current weather here
    elif option == 'Weather Forecast':
        print("Showing 5-day forecast...")
        # Add your logic to fetch and display forecast here
    elif option == 'Weather by City':
        city = input("Enter the city name: ")
        print(f"Showing weather for {city}...")
        # Add your logic for weather by city
    elif option == 'Exit':
        print("Goodbye!")
        exit()

def main_menu():
    while True:
        choice = pyip.inputMenu(['Current Weather', 'Weather Forecast', 'Weather by City', 'Exit'],
                                prompt="Select a weather option:\n",
                                numbered=True)
        show_weather_info(choice)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main_menu()
```

### What this does:

* Presents a numbered list of options.
* Lets the user choose one.
* Calls a function based on the choice.
* Loops until the user chooses "Exit".

### Example Output:

```
Select a weather option:
1. Current Weather
2. Weather Forecast
3. Weather by City
4. Exit
> 2
Showing 5-day forecast...
```

You can later integrate actual weather data using APIs like OpenWeatherMap. Let me know if you want help with that too.
