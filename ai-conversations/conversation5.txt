In Python, how can I parse a natural language weather question? The code should perform the following tasks: 

1. Identify locations mentioned in the user's query
2. Identify time periods (e.g., today, tomorrow, etc.)
3. Identify weather attributes (e.g., temperature, rain, humidity, etc.) 

AI:

Parsing natural language queries about weather to extract locations, time periods, and weather attributes is a classic NLP task. You can use Python libraries like **spaCy** for entity recognition and simple keyword matching for attributes and time periods.

Hereâ€™s a simple approach combining spaCy (for location) and custom rules (for time periods and weather attributes):

---

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Use spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract locations (GPE - Geo-political entities).**

2. **Define sets of keywords for time periods and weather attributes.**

3. **Match words from the user input against these sets.**

---

### Code example:

```python
import spacy

# Load spaCy's English model (download with: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define possible time periods and weather attributes
TIME_PERIODS = {"today", "tomorrow", "day after tomorrow", "weekend", "next week", "this week"}
WEATHER_ATTRIBUTES = {
    "temperature", "rain", "rainfall", "humidity", "wind", "wind speed", 
    "snow", "snowfall", "sunshine", "sun", "cloud", "cloudiness", "uv index", "pressure"
}

def parse_weather_question(question):
    doc = nlp(question.lower())

    # Extract locations using NER (GPE entities)
    locations = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "GPE"]

    # Extract time periods by matching known keywords
    time_periods = [tp for tp in TIME_PERIODS if tp in question.lower()]

    # Extract weather attributes by matching known keywords
    attributes = [attr for attr in WEATHER_ATTRIBUTES if attr in question.lower()]

    return {
        "locations": locations,
        "time_periods": time_periods,
        "weather_attributes": attributes
    }

# Example usage
query = "What's the temperature and rain forecast for London tomorrow?"
result = parse_weather_question(query)
print(result)
```

---

### Output for the example query:

```python
{
  'locations': ['London'],
  'time_periods': ['tomorrow'],
  'weather_attributes': ['temperature', 'rain']
}
```

---

### Notes:

* You can expand `TIME_PERIODS` and `WEATHER_ATTRIBUTES` with more synonyms or phrases.
* spaCyâ€™s default NER model may not catch all location names perfectly; you can customize or retrain for better accuracy.
* For more advanced parsing, consider using libraries like **Duckling**, **Rasa NLU**, or **transformers** with intent/entity extraction models.
