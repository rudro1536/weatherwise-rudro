# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used

For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT, and it helped me a lot. I used it to understand code, solve bugs, and write better explanations. Whenever I was stuck or confused, I asked ChatGPT and usually got a useful answer. It was like having a smart coding assistant available all the time. I didn’t use any other tools—ChatGPT alone was enough to support me throughout the project.

## Prompting Techniques

When talking to ChatGPT, I made sure to write clear and specific questions. I often explained what I was trying to do and gave small examples. If I didn’t get the right answer at first, I would rephrase my question or give more details. Sometimes I asked ChatGPT to explain things like I was a beginner, which helped me understand difficult parts better. This way of prompting gave me more accurate and helpful responses.

## What Worked Well?

One thing I’m really happy with is how smoothly I was able to fetch weather data in my project. I used the fetch-my-weather package, which made it easy to get weather information based on user input. Setting it up and connecting it with the rest of the app went well. I also added proper error handling and made sure the app gives clear messages when something goes wrong, like when the city name is incorrect or there’s a connection problem. Getting this part to work reliably made the project more complete and useful.

## What Would You Do Differently?

If I had more time, I would work more on improving how the app understands user questions. Right now, it works well for basic and clear queries, but it struggles with more complex or unclear ones. I’d also like to improve the interface a bit—maybe make it look cleaner or add a simple app version for people who don’t use code. These small changes could make the project better and more user-friendly.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a great learning experience. I improved my skills in coding, working with APIs, handling user input, and using AI tools. ChatGPT was a big help and made things easier to manage. I feel more confident in solving problems and building complete projects now. Using AI the right way saved me time and helped me learn faster. I’m proud of the final result and excited to keep building and improving in the future.
